# Search Module

This module is a demonstration of how to create a storage nmap and insert items into it.
It serves as a demo of how storage can be queried.
Once we add items to the nmap, we can then query it based on it's keys. We allow a numerical key, two string keys, and the account id as a key, mapped to a string value.
